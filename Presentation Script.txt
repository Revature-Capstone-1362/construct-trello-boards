Hello everyone, My name is Thomas Vo and I'm presenting our 1st automation that creates Trello Boards for cohorts.  The automation is designed to read input data from an excel sheet containing lists of associates, trainers, qc analysts, and the particular GitHub-Organization each associate belongs in.   In the dispatcher model aspect the Trello Boards are created first in the Initialization state. As each transaction is processed by the performer, the associate list is created and placed into the correct board.  By connecting with the Trello API, various HTTP request were made simultaneously to create Project Foundations Boards, placing each associate and assigning their week 1 requirements upon initialization.  We coded this automation by obtaining JSON ID's and Names of each board and list.  After parsing their values, a data table was created to store the information and filtered according to the criteria relevant at that particular part of the code.  Variables were assigned to the JSON values and inserted dynamically into HTTP Request endpoint URL's.  The process was repeated for each associate transaction item in the Orchestrator queue.
